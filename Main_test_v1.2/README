This folder contains some files to compile c++ programs using
ROOT and HepMC libraries.

If this is your first time using this folder, follow the next
steps:

1. Open the Makefile and modify it according to your c++ 
compiler and your local ROOT and HepMC installation folders
2. Check the .h files, where there are some libraries I have used
before. If you need another or you do not need one of the
included files that appears there, feel free to modify the files
3. Modify the HelloWorld.cc program. Write your code there!

Obs: You may need ROOT and HepMC, just one of them, or even none.
In any case, you can compile c++ programs. Read the documentation
in the Makefile and in the HelloWorld.cc program.
